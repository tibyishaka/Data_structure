# Data Structures and Algorithms  - Programming Assignment 

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the solution to **Programming Assignment 2** for the course _Data Structures and Algorithms . The assignment focuses on implementing key operations for **Sparse Matrices**, including:

- Matrix Addition
- Matrix Subtraction
- Matrix Multiplication

The project is implemented using **JavaScript**, without relying on any third-party matrix libraries. All operations are custom-built to deepen the understanding of data structures and matrix algorithms.

## 🛠️ Language & Tools

- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Text Files**: Input and output data for matrices are handled using `.txt` files with a custom format.
